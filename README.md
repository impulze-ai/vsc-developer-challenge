## JS Developer Challenge

We deeply value adaptability and a learning mindset for our engineering hires. We believe It helps to foster a culture of continuous improvement and innovation by challenging developers to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions to problems.

As a developer, we believe you must hear about VS code and its extension marketplace. Here is a coding challenge to build a VS code extension. We are not expecting you to have a prior experience with VS Code extensions and the objective here is to measure how fast you can capture new concepts.

## Problem Statement:

Assume you are working on a fintech product and you do currency conversion frequently throughout the day at work. As a developer, you spend most of the time with your code editor and you are using VS code. You are a productivity freak and want to find the currency conversion rates without leaving your code editor.

You created a VS Code extension that helps you get currency conversion rates instantly in the code editor. We would like to see how you do it. Consider the fact you can‚Äôt allow more than 4 hours for it.

If you lack some inspiration, refer to the screenshot below on how an another developer at impulze did it. But if you have a better idea, we welcome that too!

## Getting Started

1. Here we are providing you the boilerplate for creating the vscode extension or you can setup the environment referring the VSCode Developer docs.

   - [Boilerplate Code](https://github.com/impulze-ai/vsc-developer-challenge)
   - [VS Code Developer Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/api)

2. Refer to the link to know how to debug the VS Code extensions :[Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension)
3. You can get the currency rates data from `rates.json` file on the root folder -> [Link to the file](https://github.com/impulze-ai/vsc-developer-challenge/blob/master/rates.json)

## Sharing your work / result

We want you to create a public GitHub repo either by creating one or forking the [provided repo](https://github.com/impulze-ai/vsc-developer-challenge) and sharing the URL as a reply to the email.

## Resourcesüìò:

Here are some resources for you to get things close.

- [Boilerplate for creating vscode extension](https://github.com/impulze-ai/vsc-developer-challenge)
- [Vscode documentation for creating extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension)
- [Using webview in vscode extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview)

## Success Tipsüí°

- If the forked boilerplate code is not running, probably you should update your vscode version in package.json. [Refer here for more.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50748695/vs-code-extension-helloworld-sample-in-typescript-is-not-working)
- If you receive any instance of command execution error, make sure that directory ‚Äúout‚Äù exists.
  If not, execute the command `npm run watch`
- Set option ***enableScripts: true*** inorder to avoid javascript blocking on webview.
- Write meaningful commit messages
- You can show some awesomeness if you can write the test cases within the given time. But it‚Äôs not mandatory.
- The review committee will evaluate the code for accuracy, efficiency, and readability
